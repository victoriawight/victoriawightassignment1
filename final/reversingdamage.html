					<p>There are many things we can do to help protect animals in our province. The main cause of the decline of mammals is due to overhunting. By following the rules laid out by the government or obtaining the proper license, less animals will die as a result of poaching. Another main thing is not to disturb the animals. It is fine to look at them but it isn’t okay to try to pet them or get too close. This either makes them unafraid of humans or be more likely to be hit by a vehicle or get into trouble. Or they could attack the person and have to be put down. For fish, the same as mammals, don’t catch the fish that is endangered and kill it. If it happens to be caught, put it back carefully. Also follow rules on restrictions for fishing where these endangered fish are. Also, do not pollute the waterways. It hurts not only sensitive fish, but all of the fish in the water. For reptiles, do not destroy their burrows and homes because they can die being exposed to the elements as well as they could have eggs in the homes. Take caution when driving in areas in the coulees due to a large number of snakes crossing the roadways. In Lethbridge, AB, there is a road that has “snake crossing” signs so take those as seriously as a deer crossing sign.</p>
